abstraction is - generalization -to hide a complex logic
                    works at design level 


Mixins solve repetition.
Abstract classes (ABCs) enforce structure.

ABCs:
    forces subclasses to impelemt required method guaranteeing consisten behavior across system 

    where we might need it:
        patient record object  must provide to_dict() method 
        every model must implement predict() and train() 
        every hospital worker must define work_shift() 


A class becomes concrete (instantiable) only when every abstract method inherited from all parents has been implemented
