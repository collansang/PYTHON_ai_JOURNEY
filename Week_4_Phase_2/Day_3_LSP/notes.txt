Liskov Substituition Principle

It’s about behavioral contracts staying intact under substitution

If your system expects MedicationOder:
    every subclass must:
        Preserve meaning
        Preserve constraints
        Preserve side effects
        Preserve failure modes

Reject inheritance if ANY of the following are true:
    Rule 1: Subclass changes meaning
        If a subclass reinterprets:
            Units
            Thresholds
            Clinical intent
            → No inheritance

    Rule 2: Subclass adds constraints
        Example:
            “This medication must be administered with food”
            “Only valid for neonates”
            That tightens the contract → LSP violation
    
    Rule 3: Subclass removes behavior
        If something valid in base class becomes invalid:
        → Inheritance is illegal
