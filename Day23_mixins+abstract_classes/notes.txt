abstraction is - generalization -to hide a complex logic
                    works at design level 

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ABSTRACT CLASSES 
    A class becomes abstract if it contains ANY abstract method/property.
    You cannot instantiate a class with unimplemented abstract methods.
    Abstract properties require at least the getter.
    Implementing only a setter DOES NOT override an abstract property.
    Only the class that implements everything is instantiable.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT MIXINS 
    Mixins should be tiny, single-purpose.
    Mixins do NOT define __init__.
    Mixins assume the main class already has needed attributes.
    Mixins should NEVER be used alone — always alongside a main class.
    Mixins solve repetition.


Abstract classes (ABCs) enforce structure.

ABCs:
    forces subclasses to impelemt required method guaranteeing consisten behavior across system 

    where we might need it:
        patient record object  must provide to_dict() method 
        every model must implement predict() and train() 
        every hospital worker must define work_shift() 


A class becomes concrete (instantiable) only when every abstract method inherited from all parents has been implemented
