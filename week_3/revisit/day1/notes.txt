JSON is a file that we use to store data
the reason we use files is because memory disapperars when programms stops so JSON file is used because its reliable and stays when program stops
in ram(memory) = Patients = []
in files = patients.json
objects live in ram files live in disk


why we loop
We loop explicitly over patients to maintain full control over data transformation, enforce schemas and validation, handle errors per record, apply domain-specific rules, and remain independent of the storage format. JSON is a passive data container and cannot enforce any of these requirements.

why handling JSON in main.py is not a good idea 
Handling JSON directly in main.py causes duplicated I/O logic, tightly couples core application flow to a specific storage format, makes testing difficult due to file system dependencies, and violates separation of responsibilities. Persistence should be isolated behind a repository so the rest of the system remains stable when storage changes.
