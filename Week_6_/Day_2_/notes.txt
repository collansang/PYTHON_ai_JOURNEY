Architecture
    has four mandatory layers, but with metadata flowing through all of them.

1. Ingestion (Raw Clinical Fact Layer)
    Must preserve:
        observed_at (when measurement was taken)
        available_at (when system knew it)
        source system
        measurement reliability
        missingness_reason (if absent)
2. Temporal Gate (Pre/Post Diagnosis Firewall)
    Before transformation:
        You must explicitly tag every datum:
                data.is_pre_diagnosis
                data.is_post_diagnosis
3. Transformation (Context-Aware, Not Cosmetic)
    Transformation must:
        Declare what decision it supports
        Log what it changes
        Preserve original value
        Preserve reliability

4. Validation (Clinical Integrity Layer)
    Validation must check:
        Was data available at decision time?
        Is missingness explained?
        Is reliability above threshold?
        Is this measurement clinically valid for the decision?
