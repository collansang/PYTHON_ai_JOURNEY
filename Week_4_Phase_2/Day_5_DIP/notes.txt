Dependency Inversion (Clinical Assumptions):    
    Clinical decisions must depend on explicit assumptions, not concrete sources
    Guidelines, thresholds, time, and population definitions are dependencies
    Inject assumptions so they can be audited, swapped, and challenged
    A decision system without visible assumptions is unsafe by default
