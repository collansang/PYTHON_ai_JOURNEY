If B inherits from A, you are declaring something strong and permanent:
    “Every B is an A, forever, conceptually.”
If that isn't undeniably true, inheritance is the wrong tool.


parent/base.super clases can have children/derived/subclasses class\
    children classes inherit everything from parent class(attributes and methods)  
    childen class can also have their own unique attributes and methods
